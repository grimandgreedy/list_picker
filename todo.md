> - [ ] When downloads are updating quickly and I try to operate upon them it sometimes says that the indices are not in the list...


> [!Bug] Bugs
> - [ ] Fix order upon refresh
>   - [ ] when the item order refreshes (e.g. new downloads added) the selected items change. need to associate the selected items with gids and then create new selected items which will be passed back
> - [ ] (!!!) Fix cursor position upon refresh
>   - [ ] takes us back to the top when it refreshes in a different mode (I think due to filter)
>   - [ ] add pin_cursor option to pqrevent the cursor from going down when refreshing
>   - [ ] might have to do with filtering; 
>   - [ ] when original sort order there is no jumping
>   - [ ] lots of jumping when sorting by size
> - [ ] Filter/search problems
>   - [ ] ^[^\s] matches all rows in help but only highlights the first col
>     - [ ] seems to match the expression in any col but then only show highlights based on the row_str so misses matches in the second col
>  - [ ] restrict refresh so that it doesn't exit on the menu
>  - [ ] infobox causes flickering
> - [ ] Overspill of selected header column by one character
> - [ ] Prevent input field from overwriting footer values.
>   - [x] Fixed after input has finished.

> - [x] check if remove completed/errored is working

> - [x] add empty values for inapplicable cols
> - [x] get all function
> - [x] fix not resizing properly
> - [x] watch active only refreshes upon a keypress
> - [x] (!!!) add retry download function by getting download data, remove it and readd it
> - [x] info is wrong for torrents. The size, % completed, etc. Might need to rework the the data scraped from the json response.
> - [x] after nvim is opened (e.g., show all dl info) the display needs to be redrawn
> - [x] (!!!) there is a problem with the path when readding downloads sometimes. It is correct in the download info but is displayed wrong???
>   - [x] was caused by discordant order of getting download options and the main download information
> - [x] fix dir; it should be obtained from getInfo;
